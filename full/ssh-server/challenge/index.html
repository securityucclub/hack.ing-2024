            <p>Dear user, <br>
            Again, i'm writing to you to please ask you to change your password.<br>
            The one that was assigned when your account was created was too simple and<br>
            was supposed to be temporary. <br>
            This is the 3rd time this week I need to remind you this. Please take action<br>
            before someone finds out about it and gains unauthorized access with your account.<br>
            Best regards,<br>
            IT Department</p>
